# UMT-EduBot
I have Developed Edu-Bot for UMT (for my University in my FYP) in which Teacher Can Add Course Content in the form pdfs and add a List of Student Ids (Students Enrolled in the Respective Course) and then those Students log-in with their University IDs (University Emails) and Select the Course in which they are enrolled and then chat with the bot.
